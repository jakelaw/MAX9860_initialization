Description of MAX9860 & NUCLEO-F429ZI wiring and communication


WIRING:

NUCLEO-F429ZI    MAX9860
	PF0(SDA)		9(SDA)
	PF1(SCL)		10(SCL)
	PC9(MCO2)		14(MCLK)
	
COMMUNICATION:

I decided to use I2C to communicate between the twwo chips. This is required
so that all of the registers in the MAX9860 and be initialized according to our needs.

All the information was found in the following datasheets, mostly the reference manual(last one)
	http://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX9860.pdf

	FIRMWARE:
	
	The firmware consists of two functions and a main. One function is to initialize the I2C registers in the ARM processor so that it 
	is working as a master transmitter, and another to send two bytes of data at a time.
	
	All registers that are set on the MAX9860 are set to values that I believe would work for a general purpose. Microphone support was not initialized,
	but this can be easily changed by editing appropriate registers. The program only needs to be run once, and the registers
	will maintain their values after shutdown on the MAX9860.
